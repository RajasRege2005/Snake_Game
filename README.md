# Snake_Game
Using python, i have created a snake game which can cure your boredom :)
In this game, the player does not have to worry about hitting a wall as the snake shall relocate to the other end of the wall and the user can continue scoring points until the snake hits itself.
Just be aware that you don't press two keys at the same time, which can cause collision and can cause the game to end.
Enjoy :)
